# Gerrit Workflow Examples

This directory contains example scripts and code snippets that demonstrate how to use the Gerrit workflow in practice.

## Available Examples

- `gerrit-workflow-example.sh`: A comprehensive Bash script that demonstrates the complete Gerrit workflow using Git commands

## Using the Examples

### gerrit-workflow-example.sh

This script demonstrates the basic Gerrit workflow using Git commands. It shows how to create changes, update them, and submit them using the refs/for virtual branch mechanism.

#### Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

- Git installed
- Access to a Gerrit server
- The commit-msg hook installed in your local repository

#### Configuration

Edit the following variables at the top of the script to match your environment:

```bash
GERRIT_URL="http://localhost:8080"  # Replace with your Gerrit URL
PROJECT_NAME="example-project"      # Replace with your project name
BRANCH="trunk"                      # The target branch
```

#### Running the Script

Make the script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x gerrit-workflow-example.sh
./gerrit-workflow-example.sh
```

#### What the Script Demonstrates

The script walks through the following steps:

1. Cloning a repository
2. Installing the commit-msg hook
3. Creating a local branch for development
4. Making changes and committing them
5. Pushing changes to refs/for/trunk for review
6. Creating new patchsets by amending commits
7. Rebasing changes on the latest trunk
8. Cherry-picking changes to another branch

Each step is clearly commented in the script, making it easy to understand what's happening and why.

#### Learning from the Script

You can use this script as:

- A learning tool to understand the Gerrit workflow
- A reference for the Git commands needed for each step
- A template for creating your own workflow scripts

For a more detailed explanation of the Gerrit workflow, see the [Gerrit Workflow Implementation Guide](../docs/gerrit-workflow-implementation-guide.md).

## Creating Your Own Examples

If you create additional examples that might be helpful to others, please consider contributing them to this directory. Make sure to include:

- Clear comments explaining what each part of the example does
- Any prerequisites or configuration needed
- Instructions for running the example

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the examples:

1. Make sure you've configured the example correctly for your environment
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions on the Gerrit server
3. Verify that the commit-msg hook is installed and working correctly
4. Look for error messages in the output and address them accordingly
