# Gerrit Workflow Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the Gerrit workflow implementation in our modernized Gerrit project. It outlines the components we've created, how they work together, and how to use them to implement the Gerrit code review workflow.

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive Gerrit workflow that supports trunk-based development with code review. The workflow is based on the following key concepts:

1. **Change-IDs**: Unique identifiers that track changes across revisions
2. **Virtual Branches (refs/for)**: References used to submit changes for review
3. **Patchsets**: Revisions of a change that are reviewed and eventually submitted
4. **Trunk-Based Development**: All changes are eventually merged into the trunk branch

## Components

Our implementation consists of the following components:

### 1. Documentation

- **[Gerrit Workflow Implementation Guide](docs/gerrit-workflow-implementation-guide.md)**: A comprehensive guide that explains the architecture, components, and implementation details of the Gerrit workflow.

### 2. Git Hooks

- **[commit-msg](hooks/commit-msg)**: A client-side hook that automatically adds Change-IDs to commit messages.
- **[pre-receive](hooks/pre-receive)**: A server-side hook that validates that all incoming commits have valid Change-IDs.
- **[README.md](hooks/README.md)**: Instructions for installing and using the Git hooks.

### 3. Examples

- **[gerrit-workflow-example.sh](examples/gerrit-workflow-example.sh)**: A script that demonstrates the complete Gerrit workflow using Git commands.
- **[README.md](examples/README.md)**: Instructions for using the example script.

### 4. Tests

- **[ChangeIdGenerationTest.kt](src/test/kotlin/ai/fluxuate/gerrit/util/ChangeIdGenerationTest.kt)**: Tests for Change-ID generation and validation.

## How It Works

The Gerrit workflow implementation works as follows:

1. **Change Creation**:
   - Developer creates a local branch from trunk
   - Makes changes and commits them
   - The commit-msg hook adds a Change-ID to the commit message
   - Developer pushes to refs/for/trunk
   - The server creates a new change with the first patchset

2. **Change Updates**:
   - Developer makes additional changes
   - Amends the commit (preserving the Change-ID)
   - Pushes to refs/for/trunk again
   - The server updates the existing change with a new patchset

3. **Review Process**:
   - Reviewers examine the change in the Gerrit UI
   - Add comments and vote on the change
   - Developer addresses feedback with new patchsets

4. **Change Submission**:
   - Once approved, the change is submitted to the trunk branch
   - The change status is updated to MERGED

5. **Advanced Operations**:
   - Rebasing changes on the latest trunk
   - Cherry-picking changes to other branches
   - Handling merge conflicts

## Implementation Status

The following components have been implemented:

- ✅ Change-ID generation and validation
- ✅ Client-side commit-msg hook
- ✅ Server-side pre-receive hook
- ✅ Example script demonstrating the workflow
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The following components are available in the existing codebase:

- ✅ Change entity model
- ✅ Patchset entity model
- ✅ Change service for processing refs/for pushes
- ✅ REST API for interacting with changes

## Getting Started

To start using the Gerrit workflow:

1. Read the [Gerrit Workflow Implementation Guide](docs/gerrit-workflow-implementation-guide.md) to understand the concepts and architecture.
2. Install the [commit-msg](hooks/commit-msg) hook in your local repository following the instructions in [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md).
3. Install the [pre-receive](hooks/pre-receive) hook on the server following the instructions in [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md).
4. Try out the workflow using the [gerrit-workflow-example.sh](examples/gerrit-workflow-example.sh) script as a reference.

## Best Practices

When using the Gerrit workflow:

1. **Always use the commit-msg hook** to ensure your commits have valid Change-IDs.
2. **Create small, focused changes** that are easy to review.
3. **Rebase your changes** on the latest trunk before submitting them.
4. **Address all review comments** before submitting a change.
5. **Use descriptive commit messages** that explain what the change does and why.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Gerrit workflow:

1. **Missing Change-ID**: Make sure the commit-msg hook is installed and working correctly.
2. **Push rejected**: Check that you're pushing to the correct refs/for reference.
3. **Merge conflicts**: Rebase your change on the latest trunk and resolve conflicts.
4. **Review not appearing**: Verify that the Change-ID is valid and that you have the necessary permissions.

## Conclusion

The Gerrit workflow implementation provides a robust code review system that supports trunk-based development. By following the guidelines and using the provided components, you can ensure a consistent and efficient development process that maintains high code quality through peer review.
